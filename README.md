Mini-Projects
=============

A series "Mini-Projects" that have been completed by me, [Mack Mason](https://github.com/mackmason). See [Projects](https://github.com/mackmason/Projects.git) for the problems and [Solutions](https://github.com/karan/Projects-Solutions.git) for the solutions. [Karan Goel](https://github.com/karan) is the author of these problems.

The problems that I have completed are listed below, divided into categories.

## Numbers

**Find PI to the Nth Digit** - Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

**Find e to the Nth Digit** - Just like the previous problem, but with e instead of PI. Enter a number and have the program generate e up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

**Fibonacci Sequence** - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.
